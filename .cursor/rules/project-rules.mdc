# 🧠 Project Context

- Primary spec: `docs/PRD.md`
- Key references: `docs/REFERENCES.md`, `docs/API.md`
- Use these to ground all planning, coding, and documentation tasks.

When using `/plan` or `/build`, read and reference those docs to ensure alignment.

# 🏗️ Architectural Goals

- Backend: Vercel AI SDK + Blockscout MCP integration
- Output: Dockerized NodeOps-ready deployment
- Focus: clean abstractions, minimal latency, and composable agent reasoning.

# ⚙️ Development Guidelines

- Always check API schemas in `docs/API.md` before defining types.
- Keep each module independent for easier Docker build and testing.
- Reference PRD milestones when generating tasks.

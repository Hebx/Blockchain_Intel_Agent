# 🧠 Commit Discipline Rule

Whenever meaningful code or config changes are made, **generate a clear and descriptive Git commit**.

## Commit Guidelines

1. **Commit scope:**

   - Each commit should represent one logical unit of work (a small but complete milestone).
   - Avoid bundling unrelated changes together.

2. **Commit timing:**

   - After implementing or refactoring a feature or integration step.
   - After completing a PRD milestone (e.g., MCP connection working, AI agent responding, Docker container builds).
   - Before switching context or starting new work.

3. **Commit message format:**

   - [type]: [short summary]

   - [optional longer description — what changed, why, how tested]

**Types include:**

- `feat:` — New feature or capability
- `fix:` — Bug fix or patch
- `refactor:` — Internal improvement, cleanup, restructuring
- `chore:` — Dependencies, build system, configs
- `docs:` — Documentation, markdowns, PRD, rules updates
- `test:` — Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `style:` — Formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
- `perf:` — Performance improvements
- `ci:` — Continuous integration configuration changes
- `revert:` — Reverts a previous commit

4. **Frequency:**

- Commit at least once per hour of productive work or per meaningful file group change.
- Push frequently to keep remote progress visible.

5. **Automatic prompts (optional):**

- If Cursor detects more than ~50 changed lines since last commit, it should suggest:
  > “Consider committing your progress now — describe your change in a clear, atomic message.”

## Command Integration

You can use a Cursor **command** for this commit flow (see `commands.mdc` below).  
It will summarize the diff and propose a Git commit message automatically.

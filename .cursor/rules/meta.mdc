# 🧩 Cursor Meta Management

- Treat `.cursor/rules` and `.cursor/commands` as **first-class code**.
- Any update to rules or commands **must be committed** under `docs:` or `chore:` type.
- When cloning a new project, copy the latest `.cursor/` folder as a template baseline.
- After each major feature merge, run `/commit` to snapshot the rule evolution.

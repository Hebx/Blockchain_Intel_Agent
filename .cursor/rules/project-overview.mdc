# Project Overview

This project implements a **Web3 AI Agent Node** deployable via **NodeOps** using:

- **Vercel AI SDK** for conversational reasoning
- **Blockscout MCP Server** (`https://mcp.blockscout.com`) as the blockchain data layer
- **Docker** for containerization and NodeOps deployment

Guidelines:

- The project’s purpose is to let users ask natural questions about blockchain activity and receive AI-interpreted results.
- Always keep reasoning close to the PRD: conversational analysis of on-chain data.
- Maintain hackathon-level simplicity: single repo, easy deployment, clear demo.

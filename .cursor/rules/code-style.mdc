# Code Style & Conventions

- Use TypeScript strict mode; no `any`.
- Prefer async/await; no `.then()` chaining.
- Name services like `blockscoutService`, `aiService`, `queryHandler`.
- Write docstrings for functions and describe API responses.
- Keep Vercel AI SDK calls clean:

- Avoid large JSON dumps in prompts; summarize them.

- Follow functional component patterns in React.
